One of the concepts of web development that I have the most difficult time embracing is **DRY** -- Don't Repeat Yourself. The idea is that if you are typing out the same thing more than once, you are doing something wrong. This is a very rational philosophy, and I see how I could expand it beyond coding to apply it to other areas of my life. Still, it's a struggle. It's almost as if I enjoy the tedium on some subconscious level. Perhaps one too many menial jobs as a young adult?

As many new developers will admit, I write ugly, repetitive code. And I use Sublime 3 to do it. With Sublime 3, it was love at first sight. A big upgrade from Notepad, for sure. I had been so in love with Sublime that I did close to zero customizations. I was proud that I figured out how to strip extra white space from the ends of lines upon saving and left it at that.

Lately, after having a conversation with a fellow coder, I had been wondering just how much cooler I could make Sublime with a little effort. Why am I always having to type out closing tags? Is there an easier way to locate a misplaced or missing bracket? How do I change the colors on this thing? What modifications can I make so that everything is just a little less repetitive?

I did some research, and it didn't take long for my mind to be blown with the *vast* possibilities. I owe much to Chris Sevilleja, who wrote this fantastic article a few years ago:

Chris covers a lot of ground, so I'm only going to pick a couple of things to recap what an exciting evening I've had with my favorite little text editor.

## Emmet
Emmet is my answer to the probably never spoken question, "If you could only bring one package to a desert island, which one would you choose?" I cannot believe how fast I can burp out code with this, and I haven't even begun learning all of the abbreviations. Feels great to code a linked list with only a few taps of the keyboard.

## Themes! Beautiful themes!
After I got my code bopping along in Sublime much faster than usual, I decided I wanted to dress it up a bit. I settled on the Spacegray Eighties theme, which you can grab from here:

Yes. It is as cool as it sounds.
